          We are born in an incomplet world, which is not perfect yet. Our responsibility is to complet it with our ideas and projects.
          All humans are different from each other. Yes, it's true, we are unique that's what makes us speciel. 
          We are born different with a talent inside us ,but few of us can realize it. Our ideas are different, our thoughts are different and together we can build a better world that is yet to be created by us.

        		I relied on a wall, closed my eyes to could take a deep breath. 
        		But then, I couldn't open my eyes. <br>
            The thoughts plunged me inside them very deep. I could see myself inside there; as slowly
             and slowly something was destroying me over there. 

          </p>

          <p>
            I was inside a prison, whch was darker than every darkkness in the world i ever saw. The prison had no walls, but it was surounded
            with voices; as each sound was calling me for help. There was the walls of responsibilities i should pass.
